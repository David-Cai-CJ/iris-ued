    """
    Approximate reconstruction of a signal/image. Uses the multilevel discrete wavelet 
    transform to decompose a signal or an image, and reconstruct it using approximate 
    coefficients only.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    array : ndarray
        Array to be decomposed. Currently, only 1D and 2D arrays are supported.
        nD support is on the way.
    level : int or None
        Decomposition level. A higher level will result in a coarser approximation of
        the input array. If the level is higher than the maximum possible decomposition level,
        the maximum level is used.
        If None, the maximum possible decomposition level is used.
    wavelet : str or Wavelet object
        Can be any argument accepted by PyWavelet.Wavelet, e.g. 'db10'

    """
    Iterative method of baseline determination modified from [1]. This function handles
    both 1D curves and 2D images.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    array : ndarray, shape (M,N)
        Data with background. Can be either 1D signal or 2D array.
    max_iter : int
        Number of iterations to perform.
    level : int or None, optional
        Decomposition level. A higher level will result in a coarser approximation of
        the input signal (read: a lower frequency baseline). If None (default), the maximum level
        possible is used.
    wavelet : PyWavelet.Wavelet object or str, optional
        Wavelet with which to perform the algorithm. See PyWavelet documentation
        for available values. Default is 'sym6'.
    background_regions : list, optional
        Indices of the array values that are known to be purely background. Depending
        on the dimensions of array, the format is different:
        
        ``array.ndim == 1``
          background_regions is a list of ints (indices) or slices
          E.g. >>> background_regions = [0, 7, 122, slice(534, 1000)]
          
        ``array.ndim == 2``
          background_regions is a list of tuples of ints (indices) or tuples of slices
          E.g. >>> background_regions = [(14, 19), (42, 99), (slice(59, 82), slice(81,23))]
         
        Default is empty list.
    
    mask : ndarray, dtype bool, optional
        Mask array that evaluates to True for pixels that are valid. Only available
        for 2D arrays (i.e. images). Useful to determine which pixels are masked
        by a beam block.

        Baseline of the input array.
    
    Raises

    ValueError
        If input array is neither 1D nor 2D. Inherited behavior from approx_rec.
